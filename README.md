## Project - MountainCarContinuous with PPO (vectorized environments)

###  Environment   
Usually, solving the environment require an average total reward of over the threshold over 100 consecutive episodes.      
However, in this case the solution is achieved very fastly: in __21 episodes__ in __1 minute__ !  This is due to the fact    
that there are 16 processes in use in this PPO implementation notebook. We can think that the real number of episodes    
is __21x16 = 336__.

We use PPO with vectorized environments, the basic paper: [Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).    
**Vectorized Environments** (in our case there are  16 environments) is a method that means that the agent is trained in     
16 environments simultaneously.
